Please note that these risk levels indicate risk for encountering *Ixodes scapularis*. They do not indicate risk for Lyme disease or other diseases which can be transmitted by ticks.\n\n\nRisk for *Ixodes scapularis* was computed by integrating data on temperature (cumulative annual surface degree-days above 0â—¦C) and suitable habitat cover (presence or absence) collected between 2018 and 2023 to give a quantitative index of risk. Further information on the methodology used to compute risk for *Ixodes scapularis* can be found at Kotchi et al (2021) [Scientific publication] (https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13030524). Using the Jenks optimisation method and Jenks natural breaks, the risk index was categorised at a 1km2 resolution into three levels: low, medium, and high. These risk levels were produced for all postal codes within Manitoba, central Canada, and eastern Canada to assess the risk of *Ixodes scapularis* (the eastern blacklegged tick). They are not applicable for assessing the risk of Ixodes pacificus (the western blacklegged tick). Individuals residing west of Manitoba are advised to consult provincial resources and eTick to learn more about potential risk for blacklegged ticks in these regions.""",  style={'marginTop': '50px', 'whiteSpace': 'pre-wrap', 'text-align': 'justify', 'marginLeft': '50px', 'marginRight': '50px'}),
